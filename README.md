# File-Compressor

### File compression using Huffman algorithm in C++.

Pass **c** as argument to compress a file, and pass **d** to decompress. 

For example, `./a.out c wikipediaBrasil.html test` will compress **wikipediaBrasil.html** and save the compressed file at **test**.

`./a.out d test wikipediaBrasil.html` will decompress and restore the file completely.
